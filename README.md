# Image-Classification 
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images into three categories: Fauna, Footwear, and Vehicles. The project covers dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve meaningful classification results. 
## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of images categorized into three folders: Fauna: Images of animals and wildlife. Footwear: Various types of footwear images. Vehicles: Images of vehicles, including cars, bikes, and more.
## 🛠️ Libraries Used 
Pandas:For data manipulation and analysis. 
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations. 
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tools and algorithms. 
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Skimage: For image preprocessing, resizing, and transformation.
Glob: For handling file paths and retrieving images.
## 🤖 Machine Learning Model 
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Trained the SVM classifier to distinguish between the three categories. 
## 📈 Results 
The model successfully classified images into the respective categories. 
Achieved significant accuracy by following a structured preprocessing and training pipeline.
